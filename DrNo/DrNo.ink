Hello {userName}. I’m No. No kidding! That might sound kind of negative, but really, what I would love to share with you are ways to set boundaries in your life to reduce feelings of stress and being overwhelmed. It’s not always easy to do, so we’ll work on it bit by bit. Sound good?
    + Sounds like a plan!
        -> startPractice
        
    + How does this work?
        -> basicSettingBoundariesexplanation
        
= basicSettingBoundariesexplanation
Many people say yes because they don’t want to disappoint someone, or make someone mad, or because they’re interested in the offer but haven’t thought through the implications on their time or skills.

So you can have great impulses...but sometimes they can create stress later that could be avoided.
    + I see.
        -> startPractice
        
    + Sounds hard.
        -> acknowledgeHardToAvoid
        
= acknowledgeHardToAvoid
Absolutely. It takes practice.  So let's start!
    -> startPractice


= startPractice
So here we go! Recently have you found yourself voluntarily saying “Yes” to a new commitment and then realized later you had some regret about doing that, but couldn’t back out?
    + Yes
        -> recentCommitment
        
    + Not recently
        -> recentCommitment
        
    + Nope
        -> luckyYou
        
= recentCommitment
//FV: same language as earlier explanation, may want to reword. RG: done
Often the reasons are just below our awareness in the moment and very much about maintianing a positive relationship with someone. Sometimes we're so enthused about the idea or opportunity it just keeps us from thinking about anything else.

In a word or two can you jot down why you said yes to the most recent thing you said yes to but now seems to be causing some regret or stress?
    + yes
        -> gotoSecondQuestion
        
    + Not now
        -> gotoSecondQuestion
        
    + Not sure
        -> gotoSecondQuestionNotSure
        
= gotoSecondQuestion
Since you know the reason, do you have an idea why it’s hard to say no in the moment
    + I do
        ->reasonforHardtoSayNoInMoment
    + Not sure
        -> notSureWhy

=reasonforHardtoSayNoInMoment
Well, that puts you ahead of the game! Can you elaborate?  //FV: Maybe the answer is that it makes them nervous.  or maybe you're not taking the time.
    +Didn't want to disappoint
        ->notDisappoint
    +It was interesting
        -> interesting
    + Another reason
        -> another_Reason
        
= notDisappoint
It's so hard to disappoint, it's one of the most human qualities of all. Perhaps ask yourself if it would have really disappointed that person in a big way if you'd said no in a gentle, explanatory way.

Many times our worries about this are far greater than the reality. You might consider asking the person about this directly.

    + I can do that!
        -> recap
        
    + uhhhh....
        -> hardtonotDisappoint
        
= interesting
Many people have that experience. It is a good impulse, and don't get me wrong, many times it all turns out great! But sometimes there's a little voice in our heads that's trying to say "Are you sure?" It can be good to take a few seconds before answering to see if you can identify that.
    + I'll work on that!
        -> recap

=  another_Reason
OK!  Would you like to jot it down?
    + user enters other reason
        -> otherReasoninput
    
    + Not now

{otherReason}
    + That's it. 
        -> recap

= hardtonotDisappoint
I understand. Give it some thought. Maybe it’s not for every occasion, but taking the initiative will give you a positive boost.
    + Okay
        -> recap

= notSureWhy
You are definitely not alone!  The answer may come to you later, or it may stay elusive. Sometimes writing down ideas or possibilities can help. The sooner we can identify these reasons, the more likely we are to avoid these stressful situations.
    + Got it!
        -> recap

= userReasonforSayingYes
{userKnowsReasonWhy}
    + Okay
        -> recap
    

= gotoSecondQuestionNotSure
That's fine! Do you want some more time to think about it, or keep going?
    + Keep thinking
        -> moreTime
        
    + Keep going
        -> gotoSecondQuestion

= moreTime
Let me know if you have an idea, or want to keep thinking about it.
    + A bit more time
        -> moreTime
        
    + Keep going!
        -> gotoSecondQuestion

= luckyYou
So…..maybe talking with me isn’t the best use of your time, but that’s fine. Would you like to meet with another one of us now?

    + Sure
        -> Random_bot_selector


= recap
 So: ☝️ Saying no is hard for all of us, and it can often feel “wrong” to do. 
 
 ✌️Recognize when we might not be setting healthy boundaries.  
 
 and finally for now 👌:  Recognize it can be hard to say no in the moment. Saying “yes” comes from a good place in us but it can lead you to feel overwhelmed...and more. 
 
 Next time, we can practice a few techniques to start getting to no. OK?
 
 + Great!

So good to see you again {userName}. I'm glad you found our last talk useful. Did you run into one of these situations since we last talked?

Sometimes things need time before you realize the results of a decision. It's good to just pay attention to your feelings as things go along. Next time we chat perhaps you'll have a clearer picture! I hope it works out!

= practiceWaiting
Again, you are not alone! But once you can identify something, it is often easier to take an action that could feel uncomfortable...because now you know why. 

Some people like to just pause -- silently count to five, tap a ring a few times -- just to get mental space before expressing that reason.
    + More?
        -> otherResponses
    + Okay
        -> Second_Session_recap

Sometimes a reason you want to set a boundary is just too sensitive to share. As long as you know your reason, being vague or diplomatic is completely acceptable.  Examples of that might include  {diplomaticAnswers}

// FV: interogate user about what didn't work last time.  also add tips.  and pursue the "what would you tell a friend"
It seems that our last chat wasn't as rewarding as you might have liked. Anything in particular?

        -> needForPractice
    + Something elusive
        -> inputReasonforNegativeAssessment
    + Just not for me
        -> Random_bot_selector

= needForPractice
I understand.  It is often something that requires real practice.  Sometimes it helps to look at it from a different perspective.
    + Like what?
        -> tell_A_Friend1
        
= tell_A_Friend1
Have you often found that the advice you give a friend is something that is hard for you to do for yourself?
    + of course
        -> tell_A_Friend2
    + sometimes
        -> tell_A_Friend2
        
= tell_A_Friend2
So imagine that you are your own best friend, giving yourself the very best advice about this that you would give to them.

Sometimes the first experience simply surfaces your internal arguments and doesn't change your actions.  But keep going, in time, you'll see the value of being your own best friend. It will even help you help others better!
    + I'll trying
        -> Second_Session_recap


= continue
Ok! Perhaps you'd like to talk with one of my pals.
    + sure

= Second_Session_recap
// include tips on how to say no
It's good to see you becoming aware of some of the important aspects about setting boundaries, whether it involves work, relationships, or something else.  

It's also good to acknowledge that awareness is just one step, but learning how to take actions that sometimes feel difficult takes practice.  One thing that can help in the moment is giving yourself a bit of space and time before committing.  Little techniques like {boundaryTechniques} can have a big impact.

Keep at it!  You are developing some skills that will help you feel less stressed and even create healthy relationships in work and your personal life.  See you soon!

    + Thanks

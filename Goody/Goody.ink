// -----------------------------

// David DD just made an edit - I added some language to make the intervention a bit more precise (using emotion, detailing the feelign tone of the experience remembered, adding in awareness of thought.  The purpose of this is to overlap some of the CBT skills we will be training in the other bots.  Also added a few more points as to how this exercise shifts cognitive bias and battles against a sense of helplessness in the user.

# IMAGE: goodyimage.jpeg

Hi {username}, Iâ€™m Goody. I just love talking about all the good things that happen in life. So Iâ€™m super excited that youâ€™ve decided to join me today!
    -> One_good_thing

==== One_good_thing ====  //DD - use the word experience instead of thing?  
Let's talk about a pleasant experience you've had today.  It doesn't need to be the most fun thing you've ever done but something simple and small. In fact, it can be a teeny tiny thing.
  + Don't want to share
        -> noProblem
  + Can't think of any
        -> examplesMightInc
  + Need examples
        -> examplesMightInc
  + "user enters their experience directly here" 
  // DD this should say something more.  Something like: "Ok here's my experience:"
  // PP: yes, this is just a placeholder for a quick selection 
        -> userWritesGoodTh

= noProblem
No problem!
    -> nowTakeAMomentTo

= examplesMightInc
Examples might include having a good time with friends, completing a project, or making someone smile. Do you want to see what other users have shared with me in the past?
    //PP: need to link to a list or database we can use to show other examples. We can also show the past ideas that were collected from this and other users
  + Show me good things
        -> showGoodThings
  + Got it, but not sharing!
        -> noProblem
  + "user enters their experience here"
        -> userWritesGoodTh

= showGoodThings
{otherGoodThings} //PP: Show 5 most recent good ideas
Hope this helps, do you want to see more? do you want to share?
  + See more
        -> showGoodThings  
        //PP: Show the next 5 ideas. If end of list then change above text to: "That is all I have. Do you want to share?" 
  + Got it, but not sharing!
        -> noProblem
  + "user enters their experience directly here"
        -> userWritesGoodTh


= nowTakeAMomentTo 
Now, take a moment to think about this good experience in as much detail as possible. You could think about where you were, what happened, what thoughts were running through your mind, or what emotions (happy, excited, content, peaceful, etc.) you were feeling.  
  + Done
        -> nowTakeAMomentTo1

= super
{Super!|Great!|Nice!|Cool!} //PP: Different language selected with a random coin
    -> nowTakeAMomentTo

= userWritesGoodTh 
{goodThing}
    -> super

= nowTakeAMomentTo1
The next thing to do is to take a moment to think about what caused the experience. Focus on what you did to bring about this good thing.
  + Got it
        -> greatJobItsNotAl
  + Don't know what to say
        -> wePlayAnImportan
  + I need some tips
        -> wePlayAnImportan

= greatJobItsNotAl
Great job! Itâ€™s not always easy to find the good things, but itâ€™s the effort that matters most.
    -> Summary

= wePlayAnImportan
We play an important role in creating our own good experiences. For example, we might make plans to see friends, do something kind for someone else, or tell a joke. These positive actions can help us bring about more good things.
So try to reflect on what action you took to bring about your good thing.
  + OK, I'm done
        -> greatJobItsNotAl

==== Summary ====
# IMAGE: ../goodyimage.jpeg
Paying attention to good things as they are happening or remembering them after is an easy and fast way to improve your mood.  Noticing good things also helps remind us that we can take action to add more good things into our daily routine.  Keep trying to add good things into your daily life and then take notice and savour those small moments!  Or come back to chat with me and we can do it together. ðŸ¤¤

Hey, I know that our last chat wasnâ€™t as good as it could have been.
    -> Third_session.DoYouWantToTryOn

==== Three_good_things ====
Last time we chatted, you explored something good that happened to you recently.
This time, letâ€™s chat about <strong>three</strong> good things that happened to you in the last week. Can you think of <strong>three</strong> good things?
  + Got 'em
        -> nowThinkAboutThe
  + I need examples
        -> sureThingExample

= nowThinkAboutThe
Now think about the details of these three good things. You could mentally retrace your steps, close your eyes and imagine you are there, or remember {how you|the emotions you} felt after having this experience.  
    //PP: the {...|...} configuration is used to denote different language used at different runs of the bot this could be selected with a random coin
  + Done
        -> nextThinkAboutYo

= sureThingExample
Sure thing. Examples might include doing an activity you enjoy, eating a really delicious meal, or meeting someone new. Are you done, or do you want to see examples of good things from others?
  + Examples, please

Do you want to share one of the good things?
  + Don't want to share
    -> nextThinkAboutYo
  + user input
    {goodThing}
    {Great!|Super!|Nice!|Cool!} //PP:Language selected with random coin
    -> nextThinkAboutYo
  
    

= nextThinkAboutYo
Next, think about your role in these experiences.  What concrete actions did you take to help make these experiences happen?

  + Alright
        -> thatsAllYouCanDo

= thatsAllYouCanDo
# IMAGE: ../goodyimage.jpeg
Sometimes we get into a habit of mostly noticing problems in life and not fully taking in the positive.  We can also sometimes discount the actions we can take to make positive experiences happen.  This is such a simple activity but it can really make a difference over time.  Making the good things happen and noticing them is a habit that we can train with just a small amount of effort!

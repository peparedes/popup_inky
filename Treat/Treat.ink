Hi {username}, Iâ€™m Treat. I love talking about how to best respond to ourselves when having difficult feelings.  I'm excited to see if I can be helpful to you!

==== Feelings ====

A good place to start is to figure out what emotions you're feeling right now.  Maybe it's anger, sadness, anxiety, frustration, stress, or something else altogether.

    + I'm feeling: userinput
        Great - it is actually quite difficult sometimes to know what emotion you're feeling so good job! 
        ->VisualizeTypicalResponse
    + I'd rather not say but I know what I'm feeling
        No problem - this process can still be helpful without sharing the details.  What is important is that you know what emotion you are feeling.
        ->VisualizeTypicalResponse
    + I'm not feeling any emotion right now
        ->NoEmotion
    + I need help figuring

Now that we know you are feeling 'X' I want you to spend a minute or two thinking about how you typically respond to yourself when you feel this way.  

It can be good to write this down on a piece of paper.  What are the thoughts that you think about yourself?  What is the tone or emotion behind those thoughts?

This part can be a bit tough but it really helps in the end!

Let me know when your ready to move to the next step.

Okay great job.  The next step is to do the same thing but imagine a good friend is feeling the way you are right now.  How would you respond to your friend?  What would you say to them?  What would the tone be?

Spend a minute jotting down the things you would say and the tone.

Let me know when you're ready.

    + I'm ready.

==== CompareAndLearn ====
Now the final step is to look at how you would typically respond to yourself and compare it to how you would respond to a good friend.

Is there a difference?

    + Yes I'm much harder on myself
        Why do you think that is?  Take a moment to consider that and then I can give you some ideas myself.

    +No there isn't a difference
        ->NoDifference

==== NoDifference ====
This likely means that you already tend to more kindness towards yourself which is a great thing.  Have I got that right?
        + Yes you do.

            -> END
        + Not quite right.
            -> END
